# Introduction to DevOps

## Overview and Concepts explained

- *Programming* (by (teams of) developers)
- *Testing* (new and old functionality, by developers and dedicated testers)
  - should be automated as far as possible
- *Release* (by operations teams)
  - build / package source code (Output: Build Artifact and Deployment instructions)
  - distribute software to production hardware (clients or servers)
  - main goal: reduce downtimes, necessitates scalability

**Key Takeaway:** Programming and operations teams have different
responsibilities with differing skillsets and tools

This makes the necessary communication/handover between these teams very
difficult. Especially when consolidating configurations and runtime environments
between development and production. Traditionally, this is DevOps.

## DevOps tasks and responsibilities

DevOps Engineers have a subset of skills needed in both Development and
Operations teams. Over time tools and languages were developed to ease this
transitioning process, leading to a unique skillset that also encompasses the
previously needed subsets.

Due to the increased development speed enabled by agile development and the
resulting increase in releases means release cycles must be shortened. This
necessitates streamlining the traditional DevOps process.

There are many tools to automate the build, testing and deployment processes to
further that goal. This is called *Continuous Integration & Deployment*.
